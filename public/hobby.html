    <h1>Brendan Einhorn's Hobby</h1>

    <h1>New York Islanders Hockey</h1>

    <p>To begin to understand this hobby, first we need to quickly dig into one of the four major sports in the United States: the NHL. The NHL stands for the "National Hockey League." It's a 31 team league where the teams play hockey (needless to say!).</p>
       
       <p>One of the 31 teams is called the New York Islanders, and they are Brendan Einhorn's favorite hockey team. They are a team that is home on Long Island, New York (the place of Brendan Einhorn's birth and childhood). This team was formed in the 1970s and has won four Stanley Cup championships and holds a record 19-straight playoff series' wins. Currently, they are coached by Barry Trotz, managed by Lou Lamoriello and captained by Anders Lee.</p>

      <p> Brendan Einhorn regularly enjoys watching the team play in person and on television. He also regularly discusses the team with other fans online.
